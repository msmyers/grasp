 > We no longer tax activities or transactions. We tax consumption, pollution, and population.
 
 > We restrict govt money, to only come from Citizens.
 
 > All money comes from a smart contract, and each money type requires a conversion bridge that enforces rules.

# I have a dream of a better economy

We redefined government (power), we've redefined money (measurement), now it is time to redefine people and corporations.

Government split into:

 - Government split into: 
   * Rules, Decisions, and Actions. 
   * Judicial, Legislative, and Executive. 
   
 - Economy split into: 
   * Citizen, Corporation, and Government.
   * Purpose, Profit, and Planet.

# The power of rules. 

Money flows up; rules flow down.

Rules must happen, to keep us all happy, and they need money, so therefore taxes are guaranteed. Unfortunately, governments who make lots of taxes, inevitably become corrupted because the humans involved try to personally benefit from access to it.

 * We can't stop our need for govts.
 * We can't stop govts from needing money to operate.
 * We can't stop govts from being run by humans.
 * We can't stop humans from wanting to benefit. 

We can change the definition of money.

 * Separation of Power
 * Separation of Church and State
 * Separation of Participants. 
 * Separation of Value and Profit.
 * **Separation of Money and Power**

We split into participants, the activity of one benefiting all.

 * Corporations can spend Bizcoin. 
 * Governments can spend Govits. 
 * Citizens can spend Citcoin.

We partition our inventives:

 * Corporations create value.
 * Citizens receive value.
 * Governments maintain our world.

The economy runs monthly:

 * Citizens 
   - receive basic income always, plus employment or investment income during their work phase.
   - taxed by regional carbon levels and world population size.
 * Governments
   - receive income via: % of citizen MRR, % of corp revenue, % resource spent
   - taxed by national carbon levels and military size
 * Corporations
   - receive income from selling products
   - taxed by % pollution, % resources spent

# Power

## The Information system

 * Data + Authority = Claim
 * Govt, Citizen, Corporation, can all file a claim.

## The Money system

The money system source code is fundamentally open source.

Each govt in the G-8 is given a signing key. 5 of the keys are required to change the source code for the money system.

Each govt is required to run a node. This anchors the authority with the government. 

A G-8 govt is allowed to manage rules for Citizens.

## The Competition system

 > Corporations keep us competitive.
 
## The Citizen system

 > Citizens live in this world.

## The Governing system

 > Governments protect our world.

**revenue:**

 * Govt is paid with Citcoin and receives Govits.

**participation:**

 * Only citizens may vote.
 * Bizcoin cannot participate in candidate/campaign activities.
 * Citcoin can participate by donation to an Initiative or a Candidate.

**donations:**

* Citizens can donate Citcoin, up to a limit, to initiatives or candidates.
   - Govt can adopt an initiative, and receive the "pot" in Govits.
   - Candidate can adopt an initiative, and receive Citcoin donations, received in Citcoin.
     * the candidate is a citizen, and can only use Citcoin.
 * Votes are done on the blockchain.
 
**truth**

 * Political Parties have unqiue signing keys.
 * Citizen + Party = Candidate
 * A claim, to be "gold standard of truth", must be a Fact + Signature
   - Statements of truth will have a barcode to scan to verify.
   - Imagine news banners that had words + barcodes streaming together.

---

 * Citizens are isolated to Citcoin.
 * Corporations are isolated to Bizcoin.
 * Governments are isolated to Govit.
 
Corporations can trade with Citizens or Governments, and the transactions involve an auto conversion between currencies via the money contract. A smart contract converts coins on an auto adjusting exchange rate. The conversion will destroy the old, to create the new. This keeps our money supplies balanced.

## Privacy

 * Corporate income is **public public** _(we all need to see success metrics)_
 * Corporate cap table is **anon public** _(we all need to see our ruling class)_
 * Corporate transactions are **anon public** _(we all need to see how corporations move money)_
 * Citizen income is **anon public** _(we all need to see that our citizens are living fair lives)_

## Money

 * **Govit**,  
 * **Citcoin**,  
 * **Bizcoin**  

### Citcoin

 * Citcoin based upon Monero, anchored to Bitcoin chain, giving power of privacy to the Citizen.
 * Citcoin is generated each month, from the central smart contract, as basic income.
 * It is illegal to receive interest for saving Citcoin.
 * It is illegal for anything other than a Citizen to earn income in Citcoin.
 * It is illegal for a Citizen to earn anything other than Citcoin.
 * A citizen cannot earn more than 1M in Citcoin per month.
 * A citizen cannot have a net-worth of more than 1B.
 * A citizen loses their work permit once they achieve a certain net worth.
 * Retirement: 
   - the smart contract that you receive your money to, starts /dev/null the income you are receiving (taking you out of the money system, and removing the supply of money from that source).
   - forced after monthly income limit
   - forced after net worth limit
   - forced after 40 years

   - the deducted money (tax revenue) is destroyed.
 * All consumer products are purchased for Citcoin.

     - dividends from Corporate revenue
   - taxed / pay expenses:
     - pollution metric (same as citizen)
     - population density (flips into a tax/cost above X% of the world total)

One that protects the American ideals of freedom, conquest, and trade, while incorporating stewardship of our home, Earth, so many generations may enjoy her to come.

Our people live longer and longer, adding more to the workfore

Our lives are lasting longer and longer. Our populations are exploding. 

Capitalism is great, but it has no limit. 

When a for-profit intelligence has no limits, it consumes everything. 

Ambition to gain something, without any restrictions on how successful it is allowed to become, will monopolize.

It's time to rethink capitalism.

Governments involve people, and they become corrupted.



The battle between Capitalism and Socialism is a battle fought within the arena of money. What's the best system of money? We need both. 

We create 2 currencies, with strict rules around them. 



We do this to create a term limit, so citizens can enter the job market, to make income, get raises, rise the ranks, or start a new initiative



## Overview:

A citizen is guaranteed basic income. Every human starts at the same level, receiving 10k/mo once they turn 18. At that point, they also have the option to join Capitalism by applying for a permit. The permit is for 40 years, with a "early retirement" if their Net Worth exceeds 1B. The people who get that far in business, have won. Their permit is revoked, and they must return to the private life. All of their Corporate Credits are cashed into a higher Basic Income amount per month, or one-time lump sum payment of 20% of their Net Worth.

This means that people have limited time that they are allowed to compete in trade. 

Normal citizens can just enjoy the system. They are not obligated to push further. Consumer products are purchased with Citizen Coin, and the business receives Corporate Coin, via an on-demand conversion, via the smart contract. Selling things within this system requires a permit (a token that is generated from a central trade smart contract, that allows you to interact with it)



### Details:



A citizen is born, a cryptographic credential is generated from the United States of America.



A citizen applies for a permit to operate within the commerce zone. 



The permit is only valid for 40 years, with revocation required after $1B of Net Worth. 



Every citizen is guaranteed a basic income of 10k/mo, in Citizen Credits.



The world creates two currencies. 



Citizen Credits

Corporate Credits



Only citizens may spend Citizen Credits. All Citizen Credits are distributed via the Government Smart Contract. 



No govt, corporation is allowed to send/receive Citizen Credits. They must go through a bridge. 



Citizens with a permit, may receive and spend Corporate Credits, in addition to receiving the standard 





They are both operated on the same blockchain. It becomes impossible to separate Humanity from the story of us. 



You cannot do anything to change this.
